ENUMERATION:

Enumeration is the third phase of information gathering.
In this phase,attacker creates active connections to system and perform
direct queries to gain more information about the target.

1.Enumeration concepts:
2.NetBios enumeration:
3.SNMP enumeration:
4.SMTP and DNS enumeration:
5.Enumeration counterme asures:

1.Enumeration Concepts:
>Enumeration can only be done when the attacker is inside
your network.
>>In this phase we do active connection with the target.
>>and we try to gather information by unauthorize access.

Types of info which can be enumerated:
1.Router info
2.SNMP info
3.DNS info
4.Machine names
5.OS info
6.User info
7.Groups info

Techniques for enumeration:
 so what are the techniques used by the hacker in order to get these
type of information.

>>gather user names using email ids:
for example test@gmail.com, here test is the username and gmail.com
is the domain.

>>gather information using default password:
whenever we are purchasing a device the device comes with default
credentials like admin username and admin password.
>>Brute force attack
>>Extract information using DNS zone transfer
>>Extract user groups from windows
>>gather information using snmp

Important Services and ports to enumerate:

FTP => 21
TELNET => 23
TCP/UDP => DNS => 53
TCP/UDP => MICROSOFT RPC ENDPOINT MAPPER => 135
UDP => NETBIOS NAME SERVICE (NBNS) => 137
TCP => NETBIOS SESSION SERVICE (SMB OVER NETBIOS) => 139
TCP/UDP => SMB OVER TCP (DIRECT HOST) => 445
UDP => SIMPLE NETWORK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL (SNMP) => 161
TCP/UDP => LIGHTWEIGHT DIRECTORY ACCESS PROTOCOL (LDAP) => 389
TCP/UDP => GLOBAL CATALOG SERVICE => 3268
TCP => SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL (SMTP)  => 25
TCP/UDP => SNMP TRAP => 162
UDP => ISAKMP/INTERNET KEY EXCHANGE (IKS) => 500
TCP/UDP => SESSION INITIAON PROTOCOL (SIP) => 5060,5061

2.NetBios enumeration:

NETBIOS (Network Basic input/output system program) ->

It is a system program that allows the communicaion
in between different applications running
on different systems within a local area network.
->It runs on UDP 137 port
->It will show us the list of machines which belong to a domain,
->It shows us the file sharing info
->the username info
->the group related info

nbtstat -A <ip> for windows
nbtscan -v -r <ip> for linux
enum4linux -a <target ip> (mostly used to see the password policy,
it can b helpful when attacking host in an org.)

3.SNMP enumeration:

SNMP(simple network management protocol)161
>>It is used to identify network information
>>in a network there are multiple devices these devices use snmp to
communicate with each other.
>>SNMP is very important to make a communication with the networking
devices but if SNMP is enabled inside your system then it is very big
drawback for your OS.
>>By default in all OS the SNMP protocol is turned off.

Exploit SNMP =>
Method 1 for deep info
>open msfconsole
>search snmp
>(12)use auxiliary/scanner/snmp/snmp_enum
>show options
>set rhost <target ip>
>run

>>The whole snmp related info stored in a database called MIB
(Management information base)

>>SNMP has three versions.
1.v1 no encryption and hashing
2.v2 no encryption and hashing
3.v3 supports encryption and hashing

4.SMTP and DNS enumeration:
   SMTP(simple mail transfer protocol)25
>>if port 25 is open you can able to look into complete mail related info
>>commands for SMTP =>

1.HELLO => Identify domain name of sender
2.EXPN => verify the mailbox
3.MAIL FROM => to identify sender
4.RCPT TO => specify the message 
5.SIZE => specify max size
6.DATA => to define data
7.RSET => reset the connect
8.VRFY => verify the mail server
9.HELP => show help
10.QUIT => terminate session

>>In case if organisation have SMTP server you can perform enumeration
>>Netscan tool pro helpful for SMTP enumeration 

>>NMAP: on Metasploitable
steps:
>ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep "smtp"
>nmap -p25 --script (use any of the script here) <target ip>
done>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


DNS (Domain Name System) 53 => 

>> robtex.com
>> dnsstuff.com
>> nslookup for dns related info
>> for linux use dig command you can also use nslookup but dig is good for linux.

dig
>dig host facebook.com
(get ip and go for who is)
>>>>cd /pentest/enumeration/dns/dnsmap
   >./dnsmap facebook.com

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

SMB(Server Message Block):445
      It is used for file sharing,printer sharing,etc with in a network.
>>smbclient -L <targer ip> --option='client min protocol=NT1'
>>smbclient //target ip/tmp
>>help
>>pwd
>>ls 
 
Enumeration countermeasures:

>>Disable SNMP or use SNMP v3
>>use premium DNS (publically available records will not show)
>>Disable 445 and 139 ports
>> while using SMTP use secure connection 
>> use SSL certificate
>> disable SMB on web and dns.


To find versions:
           nmap -sV,netdiscover
           nbtscan:nbtscan <IP> and nbtscan -v <IP/24> and nbtscan -r <IP/24> (to go through entire network)
To find the directories:
           dirb <url>,dirsearch,dirbuster

To see the port numbers on our own system:(network statistics)
             netstat -aon 
    >-a: It displays all connections and listing ports
    >-o: Displays the owning process ID associated with each connection.
    >-n: Displays address and port numbers in numerical form.
