FOOTPRINTING:
footprinting is the first most step in ethical hacking which means of gathering all the information about the target and network.info gathering helps an 
attacker to be more closer to the target.
if the target is any organisation then how many employess work in that org.,their employee id,email id,there name,etc
and if the target is any system then wht is the OS the target is using the IP,the version,abt the ports,etc
we can gather info either actively or passively as these r the types of footprinting.

OBJECTIVES OF FOOTPRINTING:
1.To know security posture
2.To reduce focus area
3.Identify vulnerabilityss
4.Draw network map

There are different methods and tools for information gathering:
1.search engine:
     we can get the information about any organisation or anyone from wikipedia like when the org. established,who is the owner,wht r the servises they provide,etc.
*there are diff. websites for info gathering for n/w and DNS footprinting and they are:
      Netcraft:it helps in findin the record of an organisation

      whois.com:  https://whois.domaintools.com/
      centralops.net: https://centralops.net/co/
      lookip.net: https://www.lookip.net/
      

on CLI:ping,nslookup


2.google dork:google dork is also known as google hacking.it is the different other way of using the google search engine which hackers and PT use for
gathering info ins the more efficient manner.

site:search for the result in the given domain.

related:search for similar web sites.

intext:find the specific word in the document

allintitle:finds the specific keyword in the website.

intitle:search for the specific keyword in the title inside the documents
 
allintitle:search for the specific keyword in the title inside the websites.

filetype:search for the specilic files like,pdf,docs,exe,etc

*also there is google hacking database page that provide us the differet ways of using google dork,we can see the diff. dorking commands provided by offensive
security.

3.Email footprinting:
Ultratool.com :  https://www.ultratools.com/tools/ipWhoisLookup
emailtracker pro which we need to download.

SPF: sender policy framework.



TOOLS ON KALI:
 Mltego:

The Harvester:theharvestor -d (domain name) -l(l is for limit the search as i have mentioned 500) 500 -b (mention the source through which u want to search
               like google,linkedin,netcraft,etc)
 Recon-ng:workspace create facebook=
modules search=modules load (load the required recon)=
               info=
             option set SOURCE facebook.com=run
          to install modules:
                             marketspace search whois=marketplace install (path)
